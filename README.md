```bash
./gaslens -detailed <bytecode_file>
```

Example:
```bash
./gaslens -detailed test_bytecode.txt
```

This provides:
- Complete opcode-by-opcode trace
- Detailed frequency analysis
- ASCII bar charts
- Technical storage analysis
- Loop detection details
- Advanced optimization suggestions

### Analyze Deployed Contract

Set your Etherscan API key in a `.env` file:
```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then analyze a deployed contract:
```bash
./gaslens -address <contract_address>
```

Example:
```bash
./gaslens -address 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

## Output

The analyzer provides comprehensive output including:

1. **Detailed Opcode Trace**: Each instruction with its gas cost
2. **Opcode Frequency Summary**: Count and total gas per opcode
3. **Top Expensive Opcodes**: Ranked list of gas-consuming operations
4. **Visual Gas Charts**: ASCII bar charts showing gas distribution
5. **Storage Analysis**: Hotspots for reads and writes
6. **Loop Detection**: Backward jumps and optimization warnings
7. **Function Analysis**: Gas consumption per function selector
8. **Optimization Suggestions**: Automated recommendations

### Export Files

The analyzer automatically generates:
- `analysis_report.json`: Complete analysis in JSON format
- `analysis_report.csv`: Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis

## Example Output

### Simple Mode (Default)
```
🔍 SMART CONTRACT GAS ANALYSIS
================================
💰 Estimated Total Gas Cost: 21897 gas
💵 Approximate Cost (20 gwei): $1.3138 USD
⭐ Gas Efficiency Rating: 🟢 EXCELLENT (Very efficient)

🔥 TOP GAS CONSUMERS:
   1. 💾 Storage Write (expensive!) - 20000 gas
   2. ⚙️  LOG2 Operation - 1125 gas
   3. ➡️  Code Navigation - 144 gas

💾 STORAGE USAGE:
   📖 Storage Reads: 1
   💾 Storage Writes: 1

💡 OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
   ✅ No obvious optimizations needed!

🎯 FUNCTION COSTS:
   1. Function 0x2e1a7d4d - 21822 gas (💚 Cheap)
   2. Function 0x8da5cb5b - 21800 gas (💚 Cheap)
```

### Detailed Mode (-detailed flag)
```
=== Top 5 Expensive Opcodes ===
1. SSTORE     : 20000 gas
2. LOG2       : 1125 gas
3. JUMP       : 144 gas
4. SLOAD      : 100 gas
5. PUSH2      : 78 gas

=== Top 5 Most Expensive Functions ===
1. Function 0x2e1a7d4d at PC 33 used approx 21822 gas
2. Function 0x8da5cb5b at PC 44 used approx 21800 gas

=== Optimization Suggestions ===
1. Cache storage slot 0 in memory (read 3 times)
2. High SSTORE usage detected - consider struct packing

## Gas Cost Table

The analyzer uses approximate gas costs based on the Ethereum Yellow Paper:

- **SSTORE**: 20,000 gas (storage write)
- **SLOAD**: 100 gas (storage read)
- **CALL**: 700 gas (external call)
- **JUMPI**: 10 gas (conditional jump)
- **PUSH1-32**: 3 gas (push operations)
- And many more...

## Optimization Suggestions

The tool automatically suggests optimizations such as:

1. **Storage Caching**: When slots are read multiple times
2. **Struct Packing**: When consecutive SSTORE operations are detected
3. **Loop Optimization**: When backward jumps are frequent
4. **Gas Limit Warnings**: For potentially expensive operations
